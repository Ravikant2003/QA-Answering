The lateral top mount hooks over the ledge where the door window rolls up and down from, while the bottom strap with clip extends down the door panel and hooks under it at the base, ratcheting it taunt.

They are designed to put on then off when not towing. There are other more permanent options available for US trucks as I recall when searching for towing mirrors for my 06 Tundra.

"question: What parts do I need to completely replace my Atwood water heater with a new DSI G6A-8E heater and what is included with the above unit? context: Not sure what you are needing to know. The lower port on the back of the water heater is for the cold water supply. The upper port is for the hot water supply. If you need the water connections, the easiest way to do so is with shark bite fittings. Most campers come with 1/2"" pex type water line. You can get 1/2"" male shark bite fittings to make your connections. Make positively sure that you seat the water line to the bottom of the fitting or you will have a nice mess to clean up. When I install them, I use wirsbo aqua pex and my expander tool and appropriate fittings. However, if you do not have access to this it is expensive as the expander tool alone is $400.00. The shark bite fitting usually come in around $20.00. You will find the sharke bite fittings to be pretty easy, just make sure to seat them well as for warned.

"question: What parts do I need to completely replace my Atwood water heater with a new DSI G6A-8E heater and what is included with the above unit? context: It is easier then the old one.  When you take out the old one remember to take off the 90 degree elbow and use it on the bottom of the new one.  This way you will have more room to turn it in the back of the compartment, if it is as small as mine was.  The top line is hot and the lower line is cold.  There should be a cover plate in the back of your existing unit, you need to take it off to access the water lines, it is a tight fit.  One can be turned by hand, but the lower one (cold water) is a little difficult, you may have to use a wrench to get it to turn at first.  I hope that this helps and is what you are asking.  Good luck

   It is easier then the old one.  When you take out the old one remember to take off the 90 degree elbow and use it on the bottom of the new one.  This way you will have more room to turn it in the back of the compartment, if it is as small as mine was.  The top line is hot and the lower line is cold.  There should be a cover plate in the back of your existing unit, you need to take it off to access the water lines, it is a tight fit.  One can be turned by hand, but the lower one (cold water) is a little difficult, you may have to use a wrench to get it to turn at first.  I hope that this helps and is what you are asking.  Good luck

"question: can i use 46155 Taillight Converter Universal Kit. for 2005 Infiniti FX35 context: I do not know what vehicle you are trying to adapt. This unit is used on vehicles that have separate lights for turn and brake signals. it combines those signals  so that the single lamp turn/brake taillight will operate. My installation is on a Ford Escape. Connection was simple and it worked right off without problems.  Just pop the taillights out or fish around the back of the vehicle, connect to 4 wires with quick connectors and screw one to ground and you are in business. If you have a permanent hitch or receiver and this is intended to be a permanent install, I recommend that you smear some silicone sealer over the quick connectors, because, salt on the roads in winter can corrode the connection and cause it to fail.

"question: water spots context: I emailed Meguires about a paint job on my older Ford Explorer. Seems that the body shop used a cheap clear coat over the base coat and began to haze prematurely. I suspected the clear coat was sprayed on too thin. I live in the southwest and auto paint is subject to harsh summer heat. I asked the shop to spray four clear coats but I'm sure they didn't and used some cheap stuff because paint failure happens after a couple of years but anyway, The customer care guys at Meguires suggested I use this product with a grey foam pad( I used a yellow) and my car looked like new after I finished it. The oxidized paint came right off. I also put the synthetic sealer soon afterwards and even left that on overnight to bind with the paint. You really dont need to polish your car often if you wash it by hand using a microfiber wash cloth and Meguires car wash then spray on the synthetic detailer (while car is still wet) dry off with a dry microfiber cloth. The polish is only to SLICK UP THE FINISH. Sometimes the birds get to my car and I polish that off after the hand wash but once the suface is slick and sealed, evrything will wash right off. You are right though, you go polish off some of the paint when you do this so go easy, low RPM on your rotary polisher,light pressure and remember to seal it up ! this stuff really worked well for me, I used a Dewalt rotary polisher that I purchased here on Amazon for about $150.00 a year ago. The rotary polisher is a little more difficult to use than the orbital(much lower oscillations per second) and you might want to consider that first. I have seen those at Harbour Freight Sales for about $25.00. I hope that helps !



    I emailed Meguires about a paint job on my older Ford Explorer. Seems that the body shop used a cheap clear coat over the base coat and began to haze prematurely.

"question: water spots context: This is fine ""cut"" cleaner, though it's called Mirror Glaze(which is confusing-look at the red meter on left, and go lower to get finer grits), and #5 is surely an abrasive for removing scratches, heavy oxidation, etc....and should not be a repeat process over the same panels.

"question: water spots context: I read that some Honda models have water based paint jobs. It's Hondas attempt at going green.

    No. I am speaking specifically for the Acura 3.5 RL.The Tap barely goes beyond the spark plug threads. Remember, at TDC there is still space in the curved part of the head, so don't keep drilling when you think that you've cleared the spark plug hole- measure the length of the spark plug hole and you can figure out how deep you've drilled.

"question: Does the piloted reamer tap have a 3/8"" socket hole inside the top nut section? context: Yes, the inserts are ferrous.  However, the spark plugs are also ferrous.  Essentially you are screwing a ferrous plug into a ferrous threaded lining which is all threaded into the aluminum block.  The only other real choice is to fully disassemble you head and have the spark plug hole repaired with welding.  Everything will be alloy, but the distortion of the head caused by the welding will require a minimum of the head being planed and possibly camshaft bores being out of alignment, leading  to excess wear of camshaft bearings.PS ... I have used these inserts and they are performing fine in a 2.7 litre turbocharged V6.

"question: Does the piloted reamer tap have a 3/8"" socket hole inside the top nut section? context: If you are just going to clean-up the spark plug hole threads you can use this tool providing you can get to thew hole.  However, it is less expense to buy a 144mm 1.25 tap for about $6. If you are going to install a Helicoil insert in the hole you first have to enlarge the spark plug hole to 5/8 inch diameter with a 5/8 inch drill which is not included in this kit.  Can you get a drill motor with the 5/8 inch drill aligned with the center line of the hole?  There right angle drill motors which are not as long as a standard. It is very important you drill the hole straight, i.e., on the center line of the spark plug hole and hole must be round and not oval shape to have full hreads for the insert.  You can use a cannister vacuum cleaner with a wand to suck up the drill shavings as you drill.  Some shavings will probably fall into the cylinder.  To get them out I would leave the spark plug out of the hole and turn-over the engine with the starter a few times with ignition coil wire disconnected to blow the shavings out of the cylinder via the open exhaust valve or out the spark plug hole.  The instructions in the kit tell you to use a high temperature thread sealant when installing the Heliciol insert.  This sealant is not included in the kit.  You can order this thread sealant when you order the kit.  I cost $5-$6.

"question: can this be used on hybrid vehicles context: Depends on what ""best"" means to you.  When you compare the features, accuracy, and price that meets your needs then you have your ""best"".  I selected the original Fluke 87 over 25 years ago because it offered me everything I needed for a reasonable price and I expected it to last at least 5-10 years.  Selecting the newer Fluke 87-5 when my old one died didn't take much thought.  For my varied uses, electronics, electrician work, automotive, etc. there were many DMMs that would do the job, some cheaper, less accuracy, not as durable construction, or have other features.  I stuck with what I knew worked and kept working.  If you are just checking caps, there's a lot of less expensive choices and ones that will test larger value caps.

"question: can this be used on hybrid vehicles context: In my opinion this is the best meter in the $300-400 range.  It has a wide feature set and good accuracy.  However for general electronics purposes this should suit you nicely.  ""Best"" is a fun word when talking DMMs and can be a bit ambiguous, there are handheld meters at twice and as much as five times this cost that have accuracy and resolution that will blow your mind.  That said the feature your most interested in when it comes to DMMs is repeatablity.  Making sure that when you take the measurement with all the same conditions, you get the same result.  That is why I love my 87-V and why its become the first meter I grab when I need a solid base line.

"question: chipped glass? context: Most RV-ers don't have a place to park their RVs indoors. The key is to park it someplace where contaminants won't get on the coating until it cures. So... Don't park it under a tree where sap will get on it. Don't park it where a sprinkler system might turn on a spray hard water on the RV. Don't go driving across the state where bugs will get all over the leading edges. Try to pick an afternoon where you'll get at least a couple of hours of curing in before it rains. The reason for all this is that the moisture in the air is the catalyst that causes the polymers in RejeX to cross-link into a water-clear, high-release coating without pores or voids. It's not the end of the world if it happens, but ideally you don't want contaminants embedding into the coating while it cures. Main thing is that while you're working and while it's curing, don't park your vehicle in an area where it will be subject to contaminants. I usually RejeX and cure my vehicles in my driveway because there are no overhanging limbs and there isn't much traffic back there. Hope that helps.

"question: which rwrrminanwhich terminal disconnect pos or neg context: Your question is not quite logical friend.  One of the primary reasons that you would purchase this device is to make total battery disconnect so you won't suffer battery drain from the clock and other ""ghost"" devices.  I have found that in my pickup (GMC) and SUV (Ford Escape) that if I don't use one them for a week the battery will drain to ""dead"" in 7 to 10 days.  If this happens a few times the battery life is drastically shortened.  Installing and using the switch saves the life of the battery which now days isn't cheap.  The small sacrifices of losing the clock presets is really worth it.  Even the more expensive automatic disconnect won't save clock presets.  So the simple answer is either save the battery and a lot of coin or don't buy it and have go out and start the vehicle every 4 or 5 days which still taxes the bsttery.  The claim that you can save the clock presets is lame.  I haver found it to be true.

"question: HI,  are these sold individually or as a set for the price listed?  Thanks context: It's just a NC (normally-closed) switch designed to be held-open when installed to prevent a complete circuit until it is released.  It is intended to be used as an open ground but could be wired/installed to act as a ""positive"" contact.  These are about the simplest limit switches in existence.  If you can't easily grab the concept of how they work, maybe you should hire someone to do the wiring for you.","It's just a NC (normally-closed) switch designed to be held-open when installed to prevent a complete circuit until it is released.

"question: HI,  are these sold individually or as a set for the price listed?  Thanks context: circuit is open (no power) when spring loaded pin is pressed down... when pin is ""up"" the circuit is closed and there is power to whatever is wired to this switch...  power lead is red clip at the bottom...  the pin switch must be grounded by the attachment nut near the top- or a separate ground wire must be used... I hope that helps some.","circuit is open (no power) when spring loaded pin is pressed down... when pin is ""up"" the circuit is closed and there is power to whatever is wired to this switch...  power lead is red clip at the bottom...  the pin switch must be grounded by the attachment nut near the top- or a separate ground wire must be used...
